# ConfigurableProgressionMessages

Adds 6 chat messages that you can configure the contents of, along with when they appear in your runs. I made this mod to make it easy for people to make certain points in a run's progression feel a bit more special using a special chat message that gets sent automatically.

### Config Options
- The message itself
- When a certain stage number is reached
	- Whether to send it again after a number of stages
- When a loop starts
	- Either on the first loop or on every loop
- When the Bazaar is visited
	- Either on the first visit or on every visit
- When the Void Fields is visited
	- Either on the first visit or on every visit 
	- AFAIK currently no mod lets you go to void fields multiple times in a run but whenever that happens it should work

All chat messages also support the normal unity rich text formatting. You can find all the available formatting options [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.textmeshpro@4.0/manual/RichTextSupportedTags.html).

Even though this is my first mod, I've tested it a lot. If there are any problems or if you got a suggestion for the mod, then create an issue on the [github repo]() or ping me in the RoR2 modding discord.
